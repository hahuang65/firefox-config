# Firefox

My personal configuration for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Note that these are specifically configuration files for Linux-based installations that read the `.pam_environment`file.
I will do my best to comment the configuration file. Feel free to crib/steal this for your own personal use.

## Usage

Run `./install.sh` to link the configuration files to the proper location
